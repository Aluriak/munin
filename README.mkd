# Munin
IRC bot made in python 3.


## Interests
Munin is fully extendable.  
See [functionnalities](https://github.com/Aluriak/munin/blob/master/munin/functionnalities/dice_launcher/dice_launcher.py) for an example of functionnality, that is 
added automatically at launch by Control module.


## Functionnality
Create a functionnality pass by specialize the [Functionnality class](), and add an import to [functionnalities init file]().  
Some examples are provided :
- dice launcher, for playing RPG on IRC;
- corrector, because your last sentence need to be correct by regex;
- helper, for print help about others functionnalities;
- todolist, for managing todolists;

-[ ] ASP database, for doâ€¦ things;
-[ ] discussion profiling;
-[ ] leave message to other peoples;
-[ ] search definition of words of wikidata;
