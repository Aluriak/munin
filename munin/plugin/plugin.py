        - do_command, defining the behavior of the module

        - debug_data, defining things to print when user want to get an overview of internal data
        - help, defining the string returned on IRC when help is asked
        - persistent_data, defining data to be stored
        - persistent_filename, defining the filename where data is saved

    Best examples of redefinition usage are the already created plugins.
